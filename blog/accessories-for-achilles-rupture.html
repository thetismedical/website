				Gel Heel Pad Inserts: One of the most common complaints with Achilles rupture boots is discomfort or
				irritation around the heel area. Gel heel pad inserts can provide extra cushioning and support to help
				alleviate these issues and make your recovery more comfortable.
			</li>
			<li>
				Compression Socks: Compression socks or stockings can help promote blood flow and reduce swelling in the
				affected area. They can also help reduce the risk of blood clots, which can be a concern for those who
				are immobilized for extended periods of time.
			</li>
			<li>
				Ankle Straps: Some Achilles rupture boots come with built-in ankle straps, but if yours does not, you
				may want to consider adding them. Ankle straps can provide extra stability and support to the ankle
				joint, which can help reduce pain and prevent further injury.

				Shoe Inserts: Depending on your individual needs and the type of boot or brace you are wearing, you may
				benefit from using shoe inserts to help correct issues with your gait or provide additional arch
				support.
			</li>
			<li>
				Waterproof Cast Covers: If you're wearing a cast or brace that is not waterproof, you may want to invest
				in a waterproof cast cover. These covers can help keep your cast or brace dry while you shower or bathe,
				which can be a major convenience and help you maintain proper hygiene during your recovery.
